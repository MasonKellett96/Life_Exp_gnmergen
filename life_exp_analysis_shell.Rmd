```{r setup, include=FALSE}

library(tidyverse)
library(gapminder)
```
This portion of text entered per 6.4.1 Exercise instructions. The code is 
grouping the dataset by Year and Country to find the maximum life 
expectancy for each country in the given year. 


```{r, echo = TRUE}
gap <- gapminder_unfiltered

gap %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  filter(lifeExp == max(lifeExp)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(year,country, lifeExp) %>%
  arrange(year) ->
  sumdat
```

# Abstract

Here, I re-examine the analysis of Oeppen and Vaupel (2002).

# Analysis

Very good analysis done here. 

```{r}
sumdat %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_smooth(aes(x = year, y = lifeExp), method = lm) +
  geom_point(aes(x = year, y = lifeExp, color = country)) +
  labs(y = "Maximum Life Expectancy")
              
  
```
